                    <p>
                        I enjoy the struggle of sitting down and thinking about a problem all the way through. I enjoy progress and the experience of getting closer and closer to a solution. I enjoy hitting dead endsâ€”only to reapproach the same problem with a different game plan.

                        I am a Cal Poly Pomona graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. During my time in college I worked part-time in the Defense Industry at Naval Systems Warfare Center (NSWC) Corona and American Technical Services Inc. Currently, I am diving into the realm of Systems Engineering at Cubic Corporations where I am able to understand the design elements of engineering practices within the Transportation Industry!

                        I am deeply passionate about the development of Robotics, Machine Learning, and Automation in order to achieve technology that contributes to the growth of society.
