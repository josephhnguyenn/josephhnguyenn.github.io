                        <h3>My Career:</h3>
                        Hi! This is a small website that I put together to aggregate all of my projects, contacts, and work! I feel as if a resume doesn't truly highlight the behind-the-scenes work, not to mention putting a face to the person. 
                        <br><br>
                        Currently, I am in the process of pursuing my passion in Software Engineering. I took the scenic route by first studying Computer Engineering and then starting my post-grad career with Systems Engineering.
                        <br><br>
                        2018 was my first experience within the professional setting of the engineering field. I started as a Defense Contractor with American Technical Services where I was groomed to be a Systems Engineer.
                        <br><br>
                        Less than a year later, one of peers decided to bring me aboard to be an official civilian employee for the DoD Navy. In this new position, I was able to do small software engineering tasks such as scripting and be a leader in a modernization project.
                        <br><br>
                        Fast forward to now, I am doing Systems Engineering, where I am able to design and facilitate new functionalities for Cubic Transportation Systems.
                        <br><br>
                        However, it is with these experiences that I am certain how the engineering process flows and exactly what step of the process I belong in.

                        <h2>Remote Pilotless Vehicle</h2>
                        An awesome project that was created as an attempt to provide basic needs for those during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown. This was a completely unmanned vehicle, controlled remotely via a command center, which could be used to transport groceries and household items to those considered high-risk.
                        <br>
                        The full report may be found <a href =" https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbawNH8bWpwkj6SoLWYys_HkhadxnxFLjQZctatrKEo/edit?usp=sharing" target ="_blank"> here</a>. 

                        <br>
                        <h2>Multithreaded Chat Server</h2>
                        Think AOL's Instant Messager (AIM). When I was 12, this was THE messaging app of its time and to understand its innerworkings was beyond me. In my TCP/IP class, I learned how internet protocols were used and decided to create something similar to AIM just to satisfy the curiousity that my 12 year-old self could not. I developed another AIM.
                        <br>
                        The project can be found <a href= "https://github.com/josephhnguyenn/Instant-Messaging" target = "_blank">  here. </a>

                        <h2>[New Idea]: Automatic Stock Trader</h2>
                        Currently, I am very passionate about the stock market from long term investments to swing trades to options trading. Although I make some terrible plays, I have the near-term goal to create and develop an app that will allow me to automatically trade throughout the day. In addition, removing emotions from a human-trader is one of the hardest thing you can do, so why not remove that variable? Currently, I have my requirements drafted for specifications and once my design is in the works, development should start soon!
